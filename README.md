# Google Play data visualisation
This desktop application visualizes Googleplay datas by using Unity game engine. For scraping datas from Kaggle we need an API, â€Œso we used Django Rest Framework to implement that. 
Dataset has been categorized in beck-end and API sends them to front-end.
In the 3D diagram, spheres represent records of our database (applications on Googleplay), by clicking on each of them, you can see more details.
